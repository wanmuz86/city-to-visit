<p><strong>Ipoh</strong> (/ˈiːpoʊ/) is the capital city of the <em>Malaysian </em>state of <em>Perak</em>. Located by the Kinta River, it is nearly 180 km (110 mi) north of <em>Kuala Lumpur</em> and 123 km (76 mi) southeast of <em>George Town</em> in neighbouring <em>Penang</em>. As of 2010, Ipoh contained a population of 657,892, making it the third largest city in Malaysia by population.</p>

<p>Originally a village, <strong>Ipoh </strong>began to grow rapidly in the 1880s after huge deposits of tin were discovered within its vicinity.[3] By 1895, it was the second largest town within the Federated Malay States, which also consisted of Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang. <strong> Ipoh </strong>was declared a city in 1988. However, following the depletion of its tin deposits and the collapse of tin prices in the 1970s, the city suffered decades of decline and neglect.</p>
